CORS POLICY 
--
Access to fetch at 'https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipns/api.uniswap.org/v1/pools/v2/ropsten.json' from origin 'http://localhost:3000' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. If an opaque response serves your needs, set the request's mode to 'no-cors' to fetch the resource with CORS disabled.
